 Hi there üëã
I am Abayeh Misomaüòé
I love programming and I want to be a full stack developer. 
Programming is everything for me. 
I picture myself sitting down on my sit with my desktop and maybe my headset on, writing my codes, getting a bit frustrated maybe because I encountered an error and getting hyped up until its solved and when it is finally solved, I am super excited!
Web development is creative and flexible, it is in high demand, it is also really fun and it gives you an opportunity to express yourself on the internet and showcase your skill.
